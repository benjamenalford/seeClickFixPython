However the noise coming from the feature is exceptionally loud, especially at night. This is more noticeable when there is no noise from traffic to help cancel out the noise from the crossing.\n\n I live in an apartment nearby and at night I can hear the sounds from the pedestrian crossing from the 10th floor of my apartment building which will constantly repeat through the entire night.\n\nI wanted to see if it was possible to reduce the sound coming from the crossing to a lower audio level. Enough so that it doesn't echo down the streets but still loud enough for those using it to hear.\n\nThank you ",
