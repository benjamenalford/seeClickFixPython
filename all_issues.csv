 I live in an apartment nearby and at night I can hear the sounds from the pedestrian crossing from the 10th floor of my apartment building which will constantly repeat through the entire night.

I wanted to see if it was possible to reduce the sound coming from the crossing to a lower audio level. Enough so that it doesn't echo down the streets but still loud enough for those using it to hear.
